<h1>Ownable Contract</h1>
<!-- Description -->
<p>
  This is a simple implementation of an Ownable contract, written in Solidity. The Ownable contract is a base contract that provides ownership functionality. It allows for a contract owner to be set, and for certain functions to be restricted to the contract owner.

<!-- Usage -->
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>
  To use the Ownable contract in your project, simply import the <code>Ownable.sol</code> file into your Solidity contract, and inherit from the Ownable contract:
</p>
solidity
Copy code
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./Ownable.sol";

contract MyContract is Ownable {
  // ...
}
The Ownable contract provides the following functionality:

The <code>owner</code> variable, which is set to the address that deploys the contract
The <code>onlyOwner</code> modifier, which can be used to restrict functions to the contract owner
The <code>transferOwnership</code> function, which can be used to transfer ownership of the contract
Here's an example of how to use the <code>onlyOwner</code> modifier to restrict a function:

solidity
Copy code
function withdraw(uint amount) external onlyOwner {
  // Only the contract owner can withdraw funds
  // ...
}
